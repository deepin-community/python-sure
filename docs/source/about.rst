About sure
==========

The assertion library is 100% inspired be the awesomeness of
`should.js <https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js>`__ which is
simple, declarative and fluent.

Sure strives to provide everything a python developer needs in an
assertion:

-  Assertion messages are easy to understand

-  When comparing iterables the comparation is recursive and shows
   exactly where is the error

-  Fluency: the builtin types are changed in order to provide awesome
   simple assertions
